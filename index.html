<h1>What is global warming?</h1>
<p1>
Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1850—the year that accurate recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981, however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last 40 years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.2 degrees Celsius, or 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.</p1>
<br/>
<p2>The result? A planet that has never been hotter. The 10 most recent years are the warmest years on record. And the warmer it gets, the more probable it becomes that we trigger climate tipping points (such as rapid glacier melt or thawing permafrost) that can transform natural systems into entirely different states and lead to more warming. </p2><br/>

<h1>What causes global warming?</h1>
<p3>Global warming results from the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases that trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere. This trapped energy comes from incoming solar radiation absorbed by the earth’s surface and re-radiated back into the atmosphere as infrared energy. </p3><br/>

<p4>Though natural cycles and fluctuations have caused the planet's climate to change continually over the last 800,000 years, it is human activity that has driven our current era of global warming. In particular, our burning of fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, gasoline, and natural gas—has led to the greenhouse effect. In the United States, the largest source of greenhouse gases is transportation, followed closely by electricity production and industrial activity.

To support global efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the United States now faces the monumental (yet achievable) task of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero no later than 2050. We must also fulfill our commitments to help developing nations meet their climate goals—a responsibility that we (and other rich, polluting nations) are currently falling short on. In better news, at the most recent United Nations climate convention, countries agreed to work toward scaling up climate finance to developing countries to at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035.<br/>

<h1>How is global warming linked to extreme weather?</h1>
<p5>As the earth’s atmosphere heats up, it holds more water, changing weather patterns and fueling more severe rainfall events. At the same time, warmer air causes more moisture to evaporate from the planet’s surface in dry weather, resulting in more frequent and intense droughts and heat waves. </p5><br/>

A 2023 paper by two NASA scientists published in the journal Nature Water confirmed the “wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier hypothesis” through a review of extreme weather events across five continents from 2002 to 2021. Among the most dramatic was a pluvial (intense period of rainfall) that began in 2019 in central Africa and was still ongoing as the study concluded. The event caused Lake Victoria’s water levels to rise by more than 3 feet and resulted in severe flooding in surrounding areas. Meanwhile a 2015–'16 drought in Brazil led to empty reservoirs and water rationing across some cities. The scientists concluded that “the global total intensity of major extreme events appears to be increasing as the world warms.”<br/>

Ocean temperatures are getting warmer too—which means that tropical storms can pick up more energy. The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season included a record-breaking 30 tropical storms, 6 major hurricanes, and 13 hurricanes altogether. With increased intensity comes increased damage and death, particularly as coastal populations grow and coastal development accelerates. Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters have been increasing in recent years; the United States experienced an unprecedented 28 of these in 2023. <br/>

<h1>What are the other effects of global warming?</h1>
Each year scientists learn more about the consequences of global warming, and each year we also gain new evidence of its devastating impact on people and the planet. They touch on every facet of our lives—our economy and livelihoods, our health, our food supply, and our ways of life. Heat stress is killing workers. Allergies, asthma, and infectious disease outbreaks are becoming more common due to increased growth of pollen-producing ragweed, higher levels of air pollution, and the spread of conditions favorable to ticks and mosquitoes. Communities are migrating from scorched or flooded homelands. Melting ice is reshaping environments and impacting lives from the mountains to the coasts.
